## Introduction 

This project focuses on methods to color images using a reference image. This model could be applied to many disciplines–mostly artistic, such as coloring old monochrome film videos frame by frame using pictures as reference. See (link)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyL6wWOHxUM&ab_channel=IgnacioL%C3%B3pez-Francos] for where we got our inspiration. We hope that this technology will be useful for historians to restore old images for educational and research purposes.
